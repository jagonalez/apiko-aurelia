Apiko Aurelia Demo

## Install
### Aurelia CLI
If you don't have Aurelia CLI you will need it globally to run the project.
```
npm install -g aurelia-cli
```

In your project folder run:

```
npm install
```

### Running the project
To run the demo, again in your project folder run:
```
au run --watch
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:9000/

This assumes Apiko is running at localhost:5000. 

If it isn't then update `baseUrl` api.js in src/services.
